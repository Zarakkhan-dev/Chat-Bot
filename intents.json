When one of the siblings, motivated by strong feelings and a desire for a greater portion, turns to the other in a planned and deadly attack, the argument reaches a terrible height. The intentional act that kills a family member may give rise to the application of Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which addresses the murder charge.
